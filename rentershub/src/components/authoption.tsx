    1. This is an agreement between you and Renters Hub.
    2. Renters Hub will connect you with tenants from all over the country. You will welcome them to your vacant houses.
    3. Renters Hub charges you commission for every tenant you get from the platform as follows: Singles, Doubles and Bedsitters= Ksh 1000, 1 Bedrooms= Ksh 2000, 2 Bedrooms= Ksh 3000 and others = Ksh 5000. Commission is due immediately the tenant makes the first payment to you.
    4. Renters Hub does not accept any other mode of payment than MPESA to the Pay Bill number 4078389, Account= COMMISSION.
    5. Renters Hub expects you to give accurate information to the house hunters all the time. Give a lot of information while posting so that you're called only by ready-to-rent tenants. We do not approve scanty information.
    6. While posting houses on our website, upload at least 10 photos covering as many details of the house as possible. We don't approve less than 10 photos.
    7. Renters Hub does not share your personal information you have provided with anyone else. We use the information to verify that you are indeed a genuine property owner/manager.
    8. If your house gets a tenant, mark it as occupied so that you are not bombarded with unnecessary calls from house hunters.
    9. If you are reported and verified as a scammer, you will be deregistered and exposed to Kenyans as someone they should avoid and prosecute.
    10. You must conduct yourself with the highest level of professionalism possible by giving accurate information to your tenants and doing what you promise them.
    11. Paying the agreed commission is mandatory. If you fail to pay even after we have delivered good tenants, you will be banned from using Renters Hub services.
